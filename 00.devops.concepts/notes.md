## DevOps Practices, Principles , Tooling 

- Sucessful DevOps is all about principles, practices, and creating a collaborative environment that 
 improves software delivery and increases business value not just adding infra tooling
 
- DevOps: Continuous Delivery, Integration, and Deployment with DevOps

```
1. DevOps Practices 
              - Iterative
              - Incremental
              - Continuous
              - Automated
              - Self-service
              - Collaborative - Culture represented by human communication, technical processes, and tools
              - Automation of processes
              - Measurement of KPIs
              - Sharing feedback, best practices, and knowledge

2. DevOps Principles
              -  Self-service configuration
              -  Automated provisioning
              -  Continuous build
              -  Continuous integration
              -  Continuous delivery
              -  Automated release management
              -  Incremental testing


3. DevOps Tool Capabilities
              - Self service project via project configuration portals
              - Policy configuration for Security, service levels, frameworks, usage, topology concerns
              - Automated platform provisioning via service tier templates, frameworks, and 
                policy enforcement points (PEP)
              - Process automation with Continuous build, test, and deployment. Code promotion and 
                synchronization across environments and servers
              - Dependency analysis and impact analysis
                

4. DevOps Value
            For value metrics, break up DevOps goals into foundational, optimal, and transformational categories.
            Foundation
                Time and effort to create new application environment
                Time to redeploy application
                Time to promote application into a new lifecycle phase
                
            Optimize
                Dynamically right-size infrastructure scale
                Re-use existing platform services and business services from resource pool instead 
                of re-building solution stack
            Transformation
                Time and effort required integrating business process, event processor â€“ creating a complex app.
                Time and effort required to apply policy across tenant(s)
                Cost to operate application per user or transaction

5. DevOps Role/Responsibilities 
         - Assessing the dev/qa/prod env
         - Writing specs and wiki
         - CI/CD management and automation
         - work with automation services and platforms
         - scripting 
         - infra management
         - performance assessment
         - Monitoring
