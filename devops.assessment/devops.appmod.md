 
Application Modernization

```
Achieve your Digital Transformation goals by modernizing your applications.

Modern applications help bridge the gap between customer expectations and your business objectives. 
Adopt new technologies and deliver the best user experience possible.


- Are you considering modernizing your applications? 
     - Modern applications provide significant advantages, including built-in 
      high availability, disaster recovery, proactive security and more efficient 
      communication paradigms. Legacy applications simply can't keep up.

- we helps organizations develop and implement their application modernization 
strategies by navigating the constantly evolving landscape of new technologies. 


   - Automate
      - Modern applications are built with automation in mind. From seamless integrations with infrastructure
        to supporting CI/CD out of the box, these technologies help you rapidly respond to changing market dynamics and the needs of your customers. 
        Plus, they can help reduce overhead costs.
   - Reduce Cost
          Although modernizing software requires an initial investment, 
          benefits in the form of reduced capital expenditures including licensing are realized almost immediately. 
          We've helped organizations develop modern applications and cut licensing costs within the first year of deployment.
  - Secure
        -  Modern applications not only use the newest libraries and 
          strategies to harden their security, but also interface with your current tools to
          seamlessly integrate into your current security posture. In addition, container technology 
          can significantly harden your applications and protect your users.



- Container Orchestration
   - More and more organizations are adopting container technologies to deliver their legacy and microservice applications in
     the cloud and on-premise. With Docker and Kubernetes, you can leverage the key benefits of orchestration to simplify the
     deployment and management of your applications, while taking advantage of advanced capabilities including built-in high availability, 
     hardened security, and improved performance.

   - Package
      - Docker is a cutting edge technology that lets you package your software applications into 
        lightweight images and containers. This simplifies the process of managing, monitoring, and
        deploying your applications across a dynamic set of physical and virtualized infrastructure, 
        while improving application density, stability, and uptime.
   - Deploy
      - Deploying your Docker applications with an orchestration system like Kubernetes will significantly 
        enhance your built-in capabilities. Kubernetes provides high availability, zero downtime updates, and 
        more to your containerized applications. In addition, it helps minimize IT overhead and management costs.

   - Enterprise Platforms
      - There are many enterprise container platforms, we'll help you figure out which one will meet your
        enterprise requirements. From on-premise datacenters to fully managed cloud environments, 
        we've worked with many companies to help them build, configure, and deploy enterprise container platforms.

- Enterprise Assessments
    - Making the jump to microservices, containers, and the latest cloud native technology 
      can be a daunting task for your organization. We'll perform an assessment to help determine the 
      proper course of action for your startup, team, or enterprise to align technology adoption with your business goals.
    - Startup
        - Startups are able to quickly adopt new application deployment paradigms. 
          We'll determine the proper modernization strategies to help your startup rapidly accelerate 
          feature development to help grow your customer base, while minimizing the impact to your bottom line.
    - Team
          - We can assess and help your small- to medium-sized team develop a strategy to adopt modern application 
            paradigms including microservices and containerization. We'll focus on how the new technology fits within 
            your current processes, and put together a plan to help your team achieve its goals.
    - Enterprise
          - Large organizations require a more in-depth assessment process to build a roadmap suitable for enterprise adoption. 
            We'll work with several of your teams, architects, and leadership stakeholders to determine the proper strategy to 
            align your business goals with new technology adoption.
