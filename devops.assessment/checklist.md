Assessment for DevOps enables organization to identify the new opportunities where you can use DevOps and 
its associated technologies with the greatest business impact and ROI.

DevOps brings operational competency into the development team to facilitate the delivery of easy to operate, reliable and resilient applications.



- Cultivate a culture of Continuous Experimentation and Learning
- Cross-Functional Team to lead the Change
- Fostering Customer-Centric Culture
- Alignment with Business Goals
- Examine and understand your Software Life-cycle
- Exercise Source Control and Revisions
- Automation for making Developers Life Easy and faster deployment
- Use Continuous Integration
- Use Continuous Delivery
- Use Continuous Feedback
- Document everything

The Benefit - How DevOps addresses those issues:

PreDevOps  - Complex, manual installation process requires high deployment effort on each test and production system.	
PostDevOps - Fully scripted installation. OSS  tools to facilitate fully automated deployment.
             This eliminates human errors, reduces planned downtime for upgrades and 
             facilitates Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.

PreDevOps   - The system is very difficult to operate	
PostDevOps  - Requirements specification phase (Waterfall) or Sprint Planning Meeting #2 (Agile)
              the non-functional requirements for operability get sufficient attention in the specifications.

PreDevOps   - Troubleshooting is difficult, because of insufficient log file information and trace functionalities	
PostDevOps  - DevOps member will support developers in implement sufficient looging- and tracing functionalities, e.g. by using logging frameworks.
              At overload or other disturbances application crashes or hangs up, requiring restart	
              DevOps will help to build resilience into the applications code.
PreDevOps   -  It is impossible to meet SLA's desired by business with application as delivered.	
PostDevOps  -   DevOps member will take care that SLA's are known before, and that operational requirements are specified and 
               implemented such that the SLA's can be met.
PreDevOps   - No or incomplete Operations Manual (Runbook)	The Operations Manual (Runbook) is written during development. 
PostDevOps  - Advanced DevOps level will facilitate Runbook driven Development.

PreDevOps   - Only Server, Filesystems and Database are being monitored, but no application specific monitoring.	
PostDevOps  - DevOps member will take care that application specific monitors are being developed as part of normal delivery process.

PreDevOps   - A significant amount of money is spent on redundant hardware for failover, but application does not achieve transparent failover.
PostDevOps  - DevOps members understand HA / DR Technologies, will participate in the selection process and ensure that application code will utilize        selected HA / DR Technology. "Building Resilience into the application code."
